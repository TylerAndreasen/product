# User Story
As a Player,
I want to be able to access and run the game,
So that I am confident I can access and run the game when content is added.


### Acceptance Criteria
- When a build of the game is released, a single runnable file is created which allows the player to play the game.
- A note is made in the README as to where this file can be found.


### Supporting Information
In order for the eventual product to mean anything to end users, there must be some method by which they are able to access and run the game. The exact manner in which they achieve this is dependent on the assumed experience level of the target demographic. Based on the current vision statement, we don't assume any more technical skills than downloading simple programs and clicking through install wizards. The current collective skill level of the team does now include the use of the Java build tool Apache Ant. Ant enables the rapid compilation of the game into an easily shared and runnable file, assuming Java is installed on the device being used.
